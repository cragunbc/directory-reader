# Overview

With this program I'm trying to prove that I can write a TypeScript program having learned a little bit of JavaScript. I'm also trying to become more familiar with
Node and it's involvement with JavaScript so that I can run JavaScript code locally in my VS Code terminal without needing to open a web browser.

The program that I wrote is a directory reader program. What the program is meant to accomplish is to look at the directory that it's provided and loop through each
item in the directory. It will then do a couple of things, which are listed below:
- Tell you what directory you passed in
- Tell you how many directories are found in the directory
- Tell you how many files are in the directory
- Tell you the results of how many directories and files were found
- Gives you the breakdown of what files fall under the given directory

# Program Purpose
The purpose for me writting this program is to demonstrate my basic understanding of the TypeScript language and it's relationship with JavaScript so that I can run JavaScript code locally on my machine without using a browser. Principles that were proven in this project are the following:

- Displaying output to the terminal
- Recursion
- Classes
- Lists
- Asynchronous Function
- Throwing and handling exceptions

# Video Link
Video link for the project will be found in the document that's been submitted to canvas

# Development Environment

Tools that were used for this project are the following:
- Visual Studio Code: Code editor that housed the code
- Languages: TypeScript, Javascript
- Framework: Node.js
- Git: Used for version control
- GitHub: Used to save the code in a repository

Programming language used:
- TypeScript: The language to write the logic that gets turned into JavaScript
- JavaScript: The actual code that the TypeScript code is turned into so that the program can run

# Future Work

- Item 1: I could add more color to the terminal so that it's easier to read certain sections of the results
- Item 2: 
- Item 3:
